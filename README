Persistent synchronized bursting activity in cortical tissues with low
magnesium concentration: a modeling study

The program is composed of several C files:

sp.c  : main file. It is used for running several parameter sets.
sn.c  : runs one parameter set.
sgy.c : routines for the excitatory cell model.
swb.c : routines for the inhibitory cell model.
nr.c  : routines from the library "Numerical Recipes" (only few of them
        are needed for this program).

The files sp.n.a3 and sp.n.a4 are parameter files.

Commands (for a Unix/Linux operating system):

To compile the program

make sp

to run the program for the two data files

sp.ex a3
sp.ex a4

to generate figure 12 in the paper (you should have the graphic program
xmgrace):

rasei.com

The file rasei.com is a Unix/Linux command procedure.
